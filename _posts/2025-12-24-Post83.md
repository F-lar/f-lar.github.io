## Day 9 `Passwords` A Cracking Christmas  

New term for self - mask attack. Similar to brute-force but filtered for a specific format, i.e. all combinations of three lowercase letters followed by 2 digits.  

#### Commands Used  
`file <filename.ext>` - Gather info about file to select the appropriate tool  
`pdfcrack -f <filename.ext> -w <path/to/wordlist.txt>` - Run dictionary attack against file  
`zip2john <filename.ext> > ziphash.txt` - Creates a hash that `john` can understand  
`john --wordlist=<path/to/wordlist.txt> ziphash.txt` - Runs wordlist against has created in prior step  

### The Task  
Retrieve the flags from the 2 files by cracking their passwords. Super short taks, but a lot to learn after. Need to return to this room later, but move on to the others now. Also, Side Quest 2 begins here.
