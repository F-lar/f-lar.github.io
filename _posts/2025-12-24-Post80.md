## Day 6 `Malware Analysis` Egg-xecutable  

For whatever reason I wasn't totally feeling AoC this year, but now I'm going to do a marathon and see how much I can accomplish before the end. Notes and posts might be blips, random notes, and combined days.

### Static Analysis  
Gathering information without executing the sample.  
| **Information** | **Explanation** | **Example** |
| :----: | :---- | :---- |
| Checksums | Used to track and catalog files and executables. | `a93f7e8c4d21b19f2e12f09a5c33e48` |
| Strings | Sequences of readable characters within an <br> executable - i.e. IP addresses, URLs, passwords. | `138.62.51.186` |
| Imports | List of libraries and functions that the <br> application depends on. | `CreateFileW` <br> Library used to create a <br> file in Windows. |
| Resources | Contains data such as the icon for the application. <br> Icon might be used to conceal malware or contain malware. |   |

#### Using PeStudio  
Can retrieve checksum from root or "footprints" section. Retrieved flag from "strings" section.  

### Dynamic Analysis  
Analysis during/after execution.  

#### Using Regshot  
Takes snapshots of registry before and after malware execution for comparison. Malware often adds a `Run` key to the registry for persistence. 

#### Using ProcMon  
Typical, start collection, execute sample, pause collection, and filter. Operations of interest include:  
 - RegOpenKey  
 - CreateFile  
 - TCP Connect  
 - TCP Receive  

### The Task  
Analyze provided sample using static and dynamic methods to capture info and flags.
