## Day 7 `Network Discovery` Scan-ta Clause  

### The Task  
Regain access to a server that has been compromised and repair it. Misc notes to follow.  

`nmap -p- -script=banner <ip-address>` - Use nmap to scan for all available ports and what's behind them.  

Logged into ftp on target as "anonymous" user. Research points: is that common for ftp? What is the `-` at the end of the command?

`nc -v <ip-address> <port>` - Use netcat to access generic app being hosted. Command didn't work out of the box but refreshing the webpage seemed to help.  

`nmap -sU <ip-address>` - Use to scan all UDP ports.  

`dig @<ip-address> TXT <fqdn> +short` - Use to get DNS records, in particular TXT records. Research point: Learn more about `dig` such as `+short`.  

`ss -tunlp` or `netstat` - Use to list listening ports.  

`mysql -D <device-name> -e "show tables;"` - Use to view tables of local SQL server.  

`mysql -D <device-name> -e "select * from flags;"` - Use to show all entries for flags.
