## Day 1 `Linux CLI`

There don't seem to be task titles this year, and each day seems to be it's own sort of room, so my typical formatting is out the window. There may not be much to write about either, but this gives me a chance to remember how my blog works.

### List of Linux commands used
- `echo`
- `ls`
- `cat`
- `pwd` (print working directory)
- `-la` flag after ls (`-a` to show hidden files, `-l` to show additional details). Same as `ll`(?).
- `grep` 
- `find` usage: `find <dir-path> <parameter> (ie, -name) <search-term>`
- `|` Send output from the one command in a string to the next
- `>` Output redirect and overwrite file
- `>>` Output redirect and append file
- `&&` Run the second command if the first is successful
- `sudo su`

### Roundup
Had fun remembering what I was doing. Got Side Quest 1 fragments 1 and 3.
