## Day 2 `Phishing`

### Anti-phishing Mnemonics
S.T.O.P. from All Things Secured. Ask the following questions before acting on a message:
 - **Suspicious**?
 - **Telling me** to click something?
 - **Offering me** an amazing deal?
 - **Pushing me** to do something now?

Second S.T.O.P reminders:
 - **Slow down**. Adrenaline leads to mistakes.
 - **Type the address yourself**. Don't use the message link.
 - **Open nothing unexpected**. Verify first.
 - **Prove the sender**. Check the real From address/number, not just the display name.

### Social Engineering Toolkit
Cli tool, launch by typing `setoolkit`. `99` always gets you back to the main menu while navigating. While typing message use `ctrl+c`.

### The Task
Create a phishing email targeting a specific user and try to harvest their creds from a fake webserver.
